# Individual_Self_Assessment


	My group project experience was a great one. I was a part of the initial group that came up with the first idea of using covid data and was eventually switched to wine analysis.
	My first task to determine what kind of technology we were going to use. It was decided that we would use Python to break down and analyze the csv file and we would use machine learning and tableau dashboard to complete the presentation. 
	My next task was to create the slides using Google Slides. This would be the basis for our presentation. I followed the rubric to complete the mock-up slides. Once the analysis was completed we would be able to add data and visuals to the slides. 
	My last task was to work on the dashboard. I collaborated with my group member, Luke, to complete this task.

	We really worked together well as a team. We used Slack and Zoom to communicate and collaborate on our tasks. And even though we were assigned certain tasks, we always provided and received feedback to enhance whatever we were working on. 

	My biggest challenge during the project was time management. My job is very demanding and trying to find the extra time to work on my tasks outside of classtime was difficult. With the help of my team, I was able to collaborate with them to create, adjust, alter, and finalize our project. 

	Our only real challenge as a team was that we lost a member of the group at the last minute. We were able to fill in where it was needed for the project to be completed. 

	Our biggest strength was our rapport with each other. Everyone got along really well and we had a great time together while working on this project. My advice for groups coming in after us is to build a good rapport and the project will run smooth, in spite of any obstacles that may occur. 

For our project we aimed to assess wine quality and whether it is possible to classify a wine based on its chemical properties. Our goal was to answer the following questions.
	1. Is a "Good" wine able to be predicted via the analysis of a wine's physicochemical properties?
	2. What physicochemical features are most responsible for determining wine quality?
	3. Can a 'good' wine be predicted using a chemical analysis agnostic of wine type (red or white)?

After our analysis we concluded that:
	1. Moderately so, an algorithm can predict a good wine. Logistic Regression was able to output an 	accuracy score of 71%. Random Forest scored an F1 of 69%.
	2. Based on Random Forest feature importance rankings, the following three provided the most 	value:
		a. Alcohol (0.17)
		b. Volatile Acidity (0.11)
		c. Density (.11)
	3. Yes - interestingly, wine type was the least important feature by a large amount.

I'm grateful for the team I was chosen to be on. Everyone was amazing and went above and beyond to create a great project and presentation.
